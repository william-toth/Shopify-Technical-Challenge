Short Assignment to build a server / web app from scratch!!

[deployed url](https://confident-davinci-91dfdf.netlify.app/)

## What Worked Well

The instructions were relatively copy-and-paste, so there was clarity on what to do.

## What Didn't

While the instructions were easy to follow, they were difficult to understand. There were a lot of moving parts, and I'm still not sure I really get how a server works, although my understanding is much better now.
